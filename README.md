## Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

## What I Learned

This project helped me deepen my understanding of:

- Structuring semantic HTML for accessibility and readability.
- Using Flexbox for layout and aligning items.
- Creating custom hover effects for better user experience.

Here's an example of the hover state I created for the social links:

css .social-links li:hover { background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%); color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%); cursor: pointer; }

## Continued Development

In the future, I aim to:

- Improve the design for accessibility by including ARIA roles.
- Experiment with adding animations for smoother transitions.
- Learn CSS Grid to build even more dynamic layouts.
